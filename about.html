<p style= "position: absolute; top:35%; left:25%; ">monke is a project that i originally developed as a typing game but has been diverted into a net art piece. 
<p style= "position: absolute; top:40%; left:25%; ">the objective is to type the randomly generated quote exactly the same as you see, as fast as you can. 
<p style= "position: absolute; top:45%; left:25%; ">there is a timer to track the speed that you are typing at and add a sense of urgency. 
<p style= "position: absolute; top:50%; left:25%; ">once the quote is correctly inputted, the typed quote is sent to the background and the next quote is generated. 
<p style= "position: absolute; top:55%; left:25%; ">once the wallpaper has five quotes, the textbox and the timer disappear to reveal the unique wall of quotes that you have typed. 
<p style= "position: absolute; top:60%; left:25%; ">a different wall will be created every time monke is run because the quotes are randomly selected.
